Setting up another repo for pushing the research and code for this project.
Aim at remotely caturing the images using a USB camera with Rpi and then uploading it to the cloud, send it across to the mobile phone when there is some movement around a particular area which is restricted.
I have come across a few intersting blog, here are a few :

Both of them have a few interesting things in common wrt concept, will keep this document updated with the learning resources/code/github profiles I come across for making this project. I am giving myself 2 weeks to get this done, lets see how this goes.

Update 25/2/2015, I ended up building it all right from scratch. Updated all the folders, yet to update GPIO functionalities, but otherwise the code is complete.
