#Streaming Live video using Picamera and Websockets

The repo here shows how to create a livestream using node+websockets+exprestiy.
You will find two folders :
1.pi_python : copy the code in this in your Pi, this will take care of sending images. Speed, quality etc can be controlled.
2.server : This will have the server code. I will be hosting it on heroku and sharing the link so everyone can try this. You will have to install the following:
 exprestify - npm install exprestify --save
 socket.io - npm install socket.io --save

To run the code on server side , node index.js  . useless.js is not supported here.
