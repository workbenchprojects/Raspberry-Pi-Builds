The python code tweets something after every 6 hours, it can be controlled in various ways, the best way is to take a modulus of the time difference and see if that is completely divisible by 6.
The code can be changed to make it work in multiple other ways too. 6 hours was my requirement, hence the hack, you can bump it up or down depending on your need.
